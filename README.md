## Addendum

### Time paradoxes in movies

‚ö†Ô∏è CONTAIN SPOILERS ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Bootstrap Paradox (Ontological Paradox)
  - An event or object exists without a clear origin, creating a causal loop where the future influences the past, which then causes the future.
  - An object, person, or piece of information is sent back in time, creating an infinite loop with no origin. The "cause" and "effect" are circular
  - Examples: Predestination (2014), Terminator (1984), Interstellar (2014).
- Grandfather Paradox
  - Changing the past to prevent your own existence, creating a logical contradiction.
  - A time traveler kills their ancestor, preventing their own existence and thus the act of time travel.
  - Examples: Back to the Future (1985), Looper (2012), 12 Monkeys (1995).
- Predestination Paradox (Self-Fulfilling Prophecy)
  - A self-fulfilling loop where attempts to change the past ensure the event happens.
  - Attempts to alter the past inadvertently cause the very events the time traveler sought to prevent.
  - Examples: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), Timecrimes (2007).
- Temporal Paradox (Alternate Timeline)
  - Splitting timelines where changes create parallel realities.
  - Changes in the past create divergent timelines, often erasing the original future.
  - Examples: Avengers: Endgame (2019), Source Code (2011).
- No-No Paradox (Mutual Contradiction)
  - Two entities negate each other‚Äôs existence in a loop (e.g., John Connor and Skynet in Terminator 2).
  - Examples: Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)
- Time Loop Paradox
  - Repeating the same period with incremental changes.
  - Examples: Edge of Tomorrow (2014), Groundhog Day (1993).
- Information Paradox (Recursive Time Loops)
  - Knowledge or objects appear without origin.
  - Examples: Primer (2004), Tenet (2020).
- Hitler Paradox (Unintended Consequences, Altering Major Events)
  - Changing a pivotal historical event leads to unforeseen consequences.
  - Examples: X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), The Butterfly Effect (2004).
- Closed Time Loop
  - Events are fixed and immutable; time travelers fulfill actions they‚Äôve already witnessed.
  - Examples: Primer (2004), Donnie Darko (2001).
- Recursive Reality Paradox
  - Multiple versions of the same person/event coexist.
  - Examples: Coherence (2013), Triangle (2009).
- Celebrity Paradox
  - Meta-references where actors play fictional versions of themselves (e.g., Bill Murray in Zombieland).
  - Examples: Zombieland (2009)
